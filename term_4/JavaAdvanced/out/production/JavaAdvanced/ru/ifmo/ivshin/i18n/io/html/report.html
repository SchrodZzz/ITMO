Минимальное предложение: [citation needed] Freedom House ranks Singapore as "partly free" in its Freedom in the World report,[120] and The Economist Intelligence Unit ranks Singapore as a "flawed democracy", the second best rank of four, in its "Democracy Index".[180][181] The latest elections were in September 2015, with the People's Action Party (PAP) winning 83 of 89 seats contested with 70% of the popular vote.[182]

Amnesty International has said that some legal provisions of the Singapore system conflict with "the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty".[183] The government has disputed Amnesty's claims, stating that their "position on abolition of the death penalty is by no means uncontested internationally" and that the Report contains "grave errors of facts and misrepresentations".[184] Singapore's judicial system is considered one of the most reliable in Asia.[185] Sex trafficking in Singapore is a significant problem. <br>
Максимальное предложение: There are a total of seven free-to-air TV channels offered by Mediacorp.[457][458] Starhub Cable Vision (SCV) also offers cable television with channels from all around the world,[459] and Singtel's Mio TV provides an IPTV service.[460] Singapore Press Holdings, a body with close links to the government, controls most of the newspaper industry in Singapore.[461]

Singapore's media industry has sometimes been criticised for being overly regulated and lacking in freedom by human rights groups such as Freedom House.[456] Self-censorship among journalists is said to be common.[461] In 2014, Singapore dipped to its lowest ranking ever (153rd of 180 nations) on the Press Freedom Index published by the French Reporters Without Borders.[462] The Media Development Authority regulates Singaporean media, claiming to balance the demand for choice and protection against offensive and harmful material.[463] Private ownership of TV satellite dishes is banned.[461]

Internet in Singapore is provided by state owned Singtel, partially state owned Starhub and M1 Limited as well as some other business internet service providers (ISPs) that offer residential service plans of speeds up to 2 Gbit/s as of spring 2015.[464] Equinix (332 participants) and also its smaller brother Singapore Internet Exchange (70 participants) are Internet exchange points where Internet service providers and Content delivery networks exchange Internet traffic between their networks (autonomous systems) in various locations in Singapore.[465][466] In the mid-1980s to 1990s, Singaporeans could also use the locally based videotext service Singapore Teleview to communicate with one another.[467] The phrase Intelligent Island arose in the 1990s in reference to the island nation's early adaptive relationship with the internet.[467][468]

In 2016, there were an estimated 4.7 million internet users in Singapore, representing 82.5% of the population.[469] The Singapore government does not engage in widespread censoring of the internet,[470] but it maintains a list of one hundred websites—mostly pornographic—that it blocks as a "symbolic statement of the Singaporean community's stand on harmful and undesirable content on the Internet".[471] As the block covers only home internet access, users may still visit the blocked websites from their office computers.[472] Singapore has the world's highest smartphone penetration rates, in surveys by Deloitte[473][474] and Google Consumer Barometer – at 89% and 85% of the population respectively in 2014.[475] Overall mobile phone penetration rate is at 148 mobile phone subscribers per 100 people.[476]<br>
